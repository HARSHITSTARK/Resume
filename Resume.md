## EXPERIENCE

### • MicroVision Inc. Redmond, WA
#### Technical Program Manager    |  Oct 2018 – Mar 2019

```
◦ Improved the delivery of service and devices by coaching product owners, scrum masters, and development team members in
all aspects of the standard Agile process, including epic and user story creation, release planning, backlog estimation, sprint
planning, daily standups, retrospectives, and sprint reviews.

◦ Lead cross-functional collaboration to accelerate process maturity and product feasibility in proof-of-concept phase.

◦ Worked with embedded firmware and FPGA hardware team members to assist management in defining program scope,
building schedule and releasing client SDKs and APIs and MEMS design.

◦ Managed software bugs and issues by ensuring their progress, scope and completion using tools such as Jira, Git.
```
### • Google LLC Mountain View, CA
#### Technical Program Manager Intern   |  Jun 2018 - Sept 2018 

```
◦ Introduced scalable NPI processes and tooling for high-volume production of Google Home hardware.

◦ Using Six Sigma techniques improved the process around the management of FATP during the PDP to automate the
calculation of cycle time and mass production assembly and identified the issues and causes during the EVT and DVT build.

◦ Drove FAI and tolerance analysis to predict the behavior of components in assembly to maximize yield and minimize rework.

◦ Performed FMEA to manage critical path sub-assemblies, components, and subsystems at contract manufacturers in Asia.

◦ Performed data-driven failure analysis with database tools & took on-the-fly corrective actions during production.

◦ Managed Product BOM using PLM applications while interfacing with suppliers, ODMs & CM partners.

### • Nevon Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai, India
#### Embedded Engineer Intern | Jun 2015 – Jan 2016

```
◦ Experienced working on complete life-cycle of product development with an experienced cross-disciplinary team.

◦ Designed the PCB layouts using Altium, assisted in firmware developing & testing of a robot arm based on
  ARM cortex M7.
  
◦ Built products with ARM Cortex M4 & M0, Arduino, and communication protocols like SPI, I2C, UART, Bluetooth.
```
## PROJECTS

### • Gesture Recognition System | Arduino, Android Studio:
◦ Recognized 3 hand gestures using accelerometer data from Arduino and
fed it to an Android phone using low cost BLE. Implemented machine learning (logistic regression) to make the system efficient.
### • IOT based Traffic Monitoring and Management System:|Raspberry Pi, Python: 
◦ Built a Twilio NB-IOT based system that detects traffic density on a route and sends a JSON data to Azure. Created Azure database to store sensor values and send alert notifications to the commuters on the route.
### • Text-to-Speech Device j Raspberry Pi, Python:
◦ Designed a device which captures an image, process it using OpenCV library, apply
OCR engine(Tesseract library) for converting the image to editable text and used google TTS tool to generate the speech for text.
### • Unseen Area Mapping Using Swarm Robotics|ATmega 2560, Embedded C:
◦ Implemented a swarm intelligence algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization) using 3 robots embedded with IR proximity sensors, wheel encoders, Zigbee modules to effectively draw a map of an unseen area using MATLAB.

## ACHIEVEMENTS

- T-mobile IoT Hackathon|Runners-Up: Developed a smart parking system which counts the number of parking slots available
    using sensors, upload the data on an IoT server and send that info as a text message to the employees of T-Mobile using Twilio API.
