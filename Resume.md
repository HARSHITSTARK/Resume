## PROJECTS

#### Driverless Car using AI|Nvidia Jetson TX2, ROS & Python: 
- Built a self-drive car and navigated it in a known map by integrating with state-estimation for closed-loop control. Programmed the car in Linux and Python along with ROS for interfacing to the bot.
#### IOT based Traffic Monitoring and Management System:|Raspberry Pi, Python: 
- Built a Twilio NB-IOT based system that detects traffic density on a route and sends a JSON data to Azure. Created Azure database to store sensor values and send alert notifications to the commuters on the route.
#### Gesture control Music App|Android Studio & Arduino:
- Developed a gesture controlled Music App, performing signal processing on the data from accelerometer to detect different gestures.
#### Unseen Area Mapping Using Swarm Robotics|ATmega 2560, Embedded C:
- Implemented a swarm intelligence algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization) using 3 robots embedded with IR proximity sensors, wheel encoders, Zigbee modules to effectively draw a map of an unseen area using MATLAB.

## ACHIEVEMENTS

- T-mobile IoT Hackathon|Runners-Up: Developed a smart parking system which counts the number of parking slots available
    using sensors, upload the data on an IoT server and send that info as a text message to the employees of T-Mobile using Twilio API.
